# Project Overview

## Project Name

Poke-pedia
[Deployed Project](URL)

## Project Description

This project will be a searchable database of pokemon. The user will be able to search for a pokemon by name and see lots of information about it such as the type(s), id, height, weight, and an image. The user will also get information on effective types of pokemon to use against the selected pokemon in a battle.

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
